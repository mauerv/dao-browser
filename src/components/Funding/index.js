        <p>The <a href='https://aragon.org/project/grants' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon Nest</a> grant program is primarily focused on developing the <a href='https://aragon.org/' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon</a> ecosystem. That said, their governance solution and vision is so encompassing than a great deal of projects that you can come up with, will directly or indirectly help the <a href='https://aragon.org/network' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Aragon Network</a>. It shouldn't be hard to find a project with aligned incentives. Even if your main focus is the overall <a href='https://ethereum.org/' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum</a> or crypto ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Proposals for funding include anything from DAOs to <a href='https://github.com/aragon/nest/issues/177' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">help scientific research</a>, re-building a popular DAO with a <a href='https://github.com/aragon/nest/pull/172' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">more reusable architecture</a>, or lower level tooling.</p>
        <p>The grants go up to <strong>150k DAI</strong> split into chunks paid out over achieved deliverables. They also give up to <strong>30k ANT</strong> as a reward on completed projects. Read everything about how to apply at their <a href='https://github.com/aragon/nest' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">github repo</a>.</p>

        <p><a href='https://molochdao.com/' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">MolochDAO</a> is solely interested in funding infraestructure tools. So PuppyDAO&trade; won't cut it here.
